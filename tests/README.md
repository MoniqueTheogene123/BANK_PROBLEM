# Bank

## Prompt
You are a bank manager. Can you debug and add logging to this banking simulation to match the expected output?

1. Run the `simulation.rb` file and fix the syntax errors.
2. Strategically add puts statements to `bank.rb`:
  - Log the customer's name and initial deposit when an account is opened (e.g., `ðŸ“– Opened account for Alice with $1000`)
  - Log the customer's name and amount when a deposit is made (e.g., `ðŸ’° Alice deposited $200`)
  - Log the customer's name and amount when a withdrawal is made (e.g., `ðŸ’¸ Alice withdrew $150`)
  - Log the customer's name and remaining balance when an account is closed (e.g., `ðŸ”’ Closed account for Alice (Final balance: $1050)`)
  - Log all transactions for a customer when an account is closed (e.g., `ðŸ“œ Transaction history for Alice [Initial deposit: $1000, Deposit: $200, Withdrawal: $150]`)
  - Log when all transactions are complete (e.g., `âœ… All transactions are complete`)

Expected Output:

```bash
ðŸ“– Opened account for Alice with $1000
ðŸ“– Opened account for Bob with $1500
ðŸ“– Opened account for Carol with $2000
ðŸ’° Alice deposited $200
ðŸ’¸ Bob withdrew $500
ðŸ’¸ Alice withdrew $150
ðŸ’¸ Carol withdrew $1000
ðŸ”’ Closed account for Alice (Final balance: $1050)
ðŸ“œ Transaction history for Alice [Initial deposit: $1000, Deposit: $200, Withdrawal: $150]
ðŸ”’ Closed account for Bob (Final balance: $1000)
ðŸ“œ Transaction history for Bob [Initial deposit: $1500, Withdrawal: $500]
ðŸ”’ Closed account for Carol (Final balance: $1000)
ðŸ“œ Transaction history for Carol [Initial deposit: $2000, Withdrawal: $1000]
âœ… All transactions are complete
